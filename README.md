**Ploceus** is a static site generator that helps you focus on content writing ðŸ“– while also enables **easy & rapid** style ðŸ’„ changes.

## Usage

Install it first

```bash
npm install -g ploceus
# Or with yarn
yarn global add ploceus
```

Create a project folder with

```bash
ploceus init <PROJECT_NAME>
```

This command creates an project folder and setup every thing for you. You should see a folder stricture like:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ content
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ conf.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ posts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foo
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ conf.yaml
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bar
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ conf.yaml
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ conf.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ site.yaml
â””â”€â”€ theme
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```
