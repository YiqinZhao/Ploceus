**Ploceus** is a static site generator that helps you focus on both content writing ðŸ“– and UI styling ðŸ’„ in an **easy & rapid** way. **Ploceus** generates site from structured content and theme files which can be built from scratch or from existing documents.

## Usage

**Installation**

```bash
npm install -g ploceus
# Or with yarn

Two folders, `content` and `theme`, need to be created in order to start building your website. Check [here](https://github.com/YiqinZhao/ploceus-example) for a simple example.

Use following command to start creating your site with build-in development server!

```

ploceus dev .
```

After you finished development, use following commands to generate site files:

```

You should see your site been built in the `dist` folder.
